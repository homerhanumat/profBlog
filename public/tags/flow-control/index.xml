      <description>Introduction This post provides a bit of guidance for students in CSC 115 who are working on the Madhava Graph exercise in Chapter 4 of the course text.
 As you will recall, the statement of the problem is as follows:
 Recall the function madhavaPI() from Section 3.4.1. Use this function to write a function called madhavaGraph() that will do the following: given a number \(n\), the function uses ggplot2 to produce a line graph of the first \(n\) approximations to \(\pi\) using the initial terms of the Madhava series.</description>
