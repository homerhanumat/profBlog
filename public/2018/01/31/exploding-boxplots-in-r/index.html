<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>
<p>Install the package from Git Hub:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;homerhanumat/bpexploder&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Call the function with the notorious <code>iris</code> data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bpexploder(data = iris,

<h2>Sizing</h2>
<p>By default the box-plot chart sizes itself so that its width is the the setting <code>relativeWidth</code> (default-value 1) multiplied by the offset-width of its grandparent node in the HTML DOM. For some layouts—including the <code>tuftesque</code> theme of this post—the default might not give you the type of control you want. In that case you may direct <code>epexploder()</code> to make the width of the chart track the offset-width of an existing DOM element. For example, if paragraphs in your document have the desired width, then create an empty paragraph in your markdown like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p id=&quot;refelem&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>To set the widget-width to a specific fraction of the element that contains the paragraph, you could again use the <code>relativeWidth</code> setting, or you might try something like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p id=&quot;refelem&quot; style=&quot;width: 70%&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p id="refelem">
</p>
<p>In either case, call <code>bpexploder()</code> with the <code>referenceId</code> setting: <label for="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">In fact I’ve been using a reference paragraph throughout this post. Note also that <em>align = “left”</em> is important in <strong>tuftesque</strong> and probably in other Tufte-based themes.</span></p>

<h2>Known Issues and Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using the Leonids theme from the <code>prettydoc</code> R Markdown package, tool-tips are not visible in Firefox or Safari. (They do show in Chrome.)</li>
<li>When <code>htmlwidgets::createWidget()</code> creates a widget it gives the widget a random Id number. For some reason this can result in spurious warnings concerning the hidden variable <code>.Random.Seed</code>. To work around this, set a seed in the <code>setup</code> chunk of your R Markdown document, e.g.:</li>
