## Resources

An informal, evolving list of useful links, with an emphasis on undergraduate statistics, computing and data analysis education.

* <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/" target="_blank">R-Bloggers</a>.  Check it daily for the latest trends in data analysis, announcements of new and updated R packages, etc.
* <a href="http://mosaic-web.org/" target="_blank">The MOSAIC Project</a>.  The leaders of this project helped make undergraduate statistics teaching with R a viable proposition.
* <a href="https://mdsr-book.github.io/" target="_blank">Modern Data Science With R</a>.  Promising textbook to support a data science curriculum.
* <a href="http://gccs.surge.sh" target="_blank">Computer Science Minor at Georgetown College</a>.  This niche program focuses on data analysis, with a bit of web design thrown in to support it.
* <a href="https://homerhanumat.github.io/r-notes" target="_blank">Beginning Computer Science with R</a>.  My notes for our introductory CS sequence at Georgetown College.  They may evolve into a proper textbook someday, but will always be free.
