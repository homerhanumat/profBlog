I am a professor of Mathematics and Computer Science at [Georgetown College](https://www.georgetowncollege.edu/) in Kentucky, USA.  My original training was in ergodic theory, but most of my teaching career has been devoted to statistics and---more recently---data science.  For a time I also worked in the history of mathematics, in both Latin and Sanskrit sources.
