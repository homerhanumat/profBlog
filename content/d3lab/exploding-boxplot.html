<h2>A Simple Widget</h2>
<p><code>bpexploder</code> represents my first foray into HTMLWidgets for R. It makes boxplots that explode upon mouse-click into jittered individual-value plots. You can configure tool-tips for the individual points.</p>
</div>
<div id="installation-and-usage" class="section level2">
<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>
<p>Install the package from GitHub:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;homerhanumat/bpexploder&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Set-up:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(bpexploder)
set.seed(5437)  # one way to avoid .Random.Seed warning from widgetId creation</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="settings" class="section level2">
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p><code>bpexploder</code> provides modest options for customization, as illustrated in the following example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bpexploder(data = chickwts,
          settings = list(
            yVar = &quot;weight&quot;,
            # default NULL makes one plot for yVar
            groupVar = &quot;feed&quot;,
            levels = levels(with(chickwts,
                                 reorder(feed, weight, median))),
            # you could adjust the group lables ...
            levelLabels = NULL,
            # ... and the colors for each group:
            levelColors = NULL,
            yAxisLabel = &quot;6-week weight (grams)&quot;,
            xAxisLabel = &quot;type of feed&quot;,
            tipText = list(
              # as many os you like of:
              # variableName = &quot;desired tool-tip label&quot;
              # leave tipText at NULL for no tips
              weight = &quot;weight&quot;),
            referenceId = &quot;reference-paragraph&quot;
            )
          )</code></pre>

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>The Javascript library is based on Mathieu Cauleâ€™s <a href="https://mcaule.github.io/d3_exploding_boxplot/">D3 Exploding Boxplots</a>, which I have modified slightly and updated for D3 Version 4. The tool-tips were originally developed by <a href="https://github.com/Caged">Justin Palmer</a> and were updated by <a href="https://github.com/VACLab/d3-tip">Dave Gotz</a>. I modified the tip-function a bit.</p>
