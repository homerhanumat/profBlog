<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This post provides a bit of guidance for students in CSC 115 who are working on the <a href="http://homerhanumat.com/r-notes/exercises-2.html">Madhava Graph exercise</a> in Chapter 4 of the course text.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you will recall, the statement of the problem is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recall the function <code>madhavaPI()</code> from <a href="">Section 3.4.1</a>. Use this function to write a function called <code>madhavaGraph()</code> that will do the following: given a number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the function uses <strong>ggplot2</strong> to produce a line graph of the first <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> approximations to <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> using the initial terms of the Madhava series.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The plot should be a line graph similar to the one produced by the <code>collatz()</code> functions from this Chapter. The function should take a single argument <code>n</code>, whose default value is 10.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It should validate the input: if the number entered is not at least 1, then the function should should explain to the user that the he/she must enter a positive number, and then stop.</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="outline" class="section level2">
<h2>Outline</h2>
<p>Based on the specification in the problem, you can set up an initial outline of the desired function, as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>madhavaGraph &lt;- function(n = 10) {
  
  validate the input: if n isn&#39;t at least 1, stop the function
    
  find the sums:
    * the sum of the first term (4)
    * the sum of the first and second terms (4 - 4/3)
    * the sum of the first three terms ( 4 - 4/3 + 4/5)
    * and so on until ...
    * the sum of the first n terms
  make sure these sums are stored in a vector (let&#39;s call it &quot;results&quot;)
  
  make the plot:
    - the vector 1:n (call it &quot;terms&quot;) gives the x-coordinates of the points
    - the results vector gives y-coordinates
  
}</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the body of the function has three primary parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>validating the input</li>
<li>finding the sums and storing them in the <code>results</code> vector</li>
<li>making the plot.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll leave Part 1 entirely to you, but say a bit more about parts 2 and 3.</p>
</div>
<div id="making-the-graph" class="section level2">
<h2>Making the Graph</h2>
<p>First we’ll think about the graph. Since it is made from functions in the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package, you will need to make sure that you load the package when you are designing the function.<label for="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">The function itself does not load <strong>ggplot2</strong>, so you should make sure to tell anyone who plans to use the function to load it!</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>Now suppose that the value of the parameter <code>n</code> is 10. Then by the time you get around to making the graph you’ll have the terms:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>terms &lt;- 1:n
terms</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10</code></pre>
<p>You’ll also have the sums, another vector of length 10:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>results</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] 4.000000 2.666667 3.466667 2.895238 3.339683 2.976046 3.283738
##  [8] 3.017072 3.252366 3.041840</code></pre>
<p>From our study of the Collatz function, we know that the way to make a line graph of these points is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plotTitle &lt;- paste0(&quot;The first &quot;, n, &quot; Madhava sums&quot;)
  p &lt;- ggplot(mapping = aes(x = terms, y = results)) +
    geom_point() + geom_line() +
    labs( x = &quot;number of terms&quot;, y = &quot;Madhava sum&quot;,
          title = plotTitle)
  print(p)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-09-27-madhava-graph-advice_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Hence we can fill in the outline of our function a bit:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>madhavaGraph &lt;- function(n = 10) {
  
  validate the input: if n isn&#39;t at least 1, stop the function
    
  find the sums:
    * the sum of the first term (4)
    * the sum of the first and second terms (4 - 4/3)
    * the sum of the first three terms ( 4 - 4/3 + 4/5)
    * and so on until ...
    * the sum of the first n terms
  make sure these sums are stored in a vector (let&#39;s call it &quot;results&quot;)
  
 plotTitle &lt;- paste0(&quot;The first &quot;, n, &quot; Madhava sums&quot;)
  p &lt;- ggplot(mapping = aes(x = terms, y = results)) +
    geom_point() + geom_line() +
    labs( x = &quot;number of terms&quot;, y = &quot;Madhava sum&quot;,
          title = plotTitle)
  print(p)
  
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="finding-and-storing-the-sums" class="section level2">
<h2>Finding and Storing the Sums</h2>
<p>The outline for this part of the task looked like:</p>
<ul>
<li>get the sum of the first term (just 1)</li>
<li>get the sum of the first and second terms (<span class="math inline">\(4 - 4/3\)</span>)</li>
<li>get the sum of the first three terms (<span class="math inline">\(4 - 4/3 + 4/5\)</span>)</li>
<li>and so on until …</li>
<li>get the sum of the first n terms</li>
</ul>
<p>At each step in above process, we will need to store our sum in the <code>results</code> vector, so that it isn’t lost.</p>
<p>The natural way to accomplish the above task is to use a <code>for</code>-loop in which we iterate by index and store results. The outline of such a loop is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>results &lt;- numeric(n)
for ( i in 1:n ) {
  
  results[i] &lt;- the sum of the first i terms
  
}</code></pre>
<p>We already know how to find the sum of the first <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> terms: we can just use the function <code>madhavaPI()</code> from Chapter 3:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>madhavaPI &lt;- function(n = 1000000) {
  k &lt;- 1:n
  terms &lt;- (-1)^(k+1)*4/(2*k-1)
  sum(terms)
}</code></pre>
<p>Hence when you are working inside the loop, you can get and store the results all in one line:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>results[i] &lt;- madhavaPI(i)</code></pre>
<p>Well, to be totally truthful, you can do this <em>provided that</em> R knows what <code>madhavaPI()</code> is. Hence you must either:</p>
<ul>
<li>hope that whoever uses <code>madhavaGraph()</code> has <code>madhavaPI()</code> in their Global Environment so that <code>madhavaGraph()</code> can look up the name <code>madhavaPI</code> when it needs it, or</li>
<li>define <code>madhavaPI()</code> inside the body of <code>madhavaGraph()</code>, before you start computing any sums.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter seems to be the safer choice!</p>
</div>
<div id="put-it-all-together" class="section level2">
<h2>Put It All Together</h2>
<p>You still have the task of filling in the outline completely and then testing <code>madhavaGraph()</code> until it works.</p>
